    Start by rotating the “from” view 90˚ around its y-axis to hide it from view.
    Next, reveal the snapshot by rotating it back from its edge-on state that you set up above.
    Set the frame of the snapshot to fill the screen.
    The snapshot now exactly matches the “to” view so it’s finally safe to reveal the real “to” view. Remove the snapshot from the view hierarchy since it’s no longer needed. Next, restore the “from” view to its original state; otherwise, it would be hidden when transitioning back. Calling completeTransition(_:) informs UIKit that the animation is complete. It will ensure the final state is consistent and remove the “from” view from the container.*/
